# About
These are my dotFiles, be warned though - there are much better examples out there!

Assumptions:
- sensitive things have been installed separately
- you are running this on macos

There is a single entry point: `bootstrap.sh`. It is designed to be idempotent. It doesn't mean it actually _is_, only that I am believing it to be :-).

Peace.
