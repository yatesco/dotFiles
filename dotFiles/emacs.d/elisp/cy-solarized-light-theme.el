;;; Code:

;; So, er, there isn't actually any code here. It turns out emacs
;; _sucks_ at handling terminal colours properly so for the best
;; experience run Solarized Light in your (iterm) terminal and have
;; _no_ emacs theme.

;; (use-package color-theme-solarized
;;   :ensure t
;;   :config
;;   (setq solarized-termcolors 256)
;;   (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions
;; 	    (lambda (frame)
;; 	      (let ((mode (if (display-graphic-p frame) 'light 'light)))
;; 		(set-frame-parameter frame 'background-mode mode)
;; 		(set-terminal-parameter frame 'background-mode mode))
;; 	      (load-theme 'solarized t))))
