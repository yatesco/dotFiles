# About
Here be dragons!

This is my emacs configuration, cobbled together from various places on the internet. 

If you are looking for inspiration on idiomatic emacs maintenance, look elsewhere. In fact, to be blunt, if you are looking here for inspiration you would be a lot better off looking at https://spacemacs.org.

It is also strongly recommended to use `iterm` rather than `Terminal.app`. Of note is the fact the cursor _won't_ change depending on the evil state in `Terminal.app`.

Modules are stored in `.emacs.d/elisp`. To edit or create a module `SPC f e m`.

Above all, peace
